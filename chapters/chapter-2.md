# Your First Algorithm: Teaching Computers to Make Predictions

Step-by-step implementation of linear regression with extensively commented Python code, transforming raw data into predictions while learning fundamental ML concepts like training, testing, and evaluation.

## Introduction

This chapter covers your first algorithm: teaching computers to make predictions. Content will be added here.


:::{note}
This is an important note for readers.

## Code Example

```python
# Example code for Your First Algorithm: Teaching Computers to Make Predictions
print("Hello from Chapter 2!")
```


## Mathematical Concepts

Here's an example equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi x} d\xi
$$

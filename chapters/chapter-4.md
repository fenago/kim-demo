# Clustering: Finding Hidden Patterns in Chaos

Discovering unsupervised learning through K-means clustering and hierarchical methods, with guided implementations that reveal customer segments and organize complex datasets without labels.

## Introduction

This chapter covers clustering: finding hidden patterns in chaos. Content will be added here.


:::{note}
This is an important note for readers.

## Code Example

```python
# Example code for Clustering: Finding Hidden Patterns in Chaos
print("Hello from Chapter 4!")
```


## Mathematical Concepts

Here's an example equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi x} d\xi
$$

# Real-World ML: From Prototype to Production

Tackling complete machine learning pipelines including data preprocessing, model selection, validation techniques, and deployment strategies through end-to-end project implementations.

## Introduction

This chapter covers real-world ml: from prototype to production. Content will be added here.


:::{note}
This is an important note for readers.
:::


## Code Example

```python
# Example code for Real-World ML: From Prototype to Production
print("Hello from Chapter 7!")
```


## Mathematical Concepts

Here's an example equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi x} d\xi
$$

# Neural Networks: Building Artificial Brains from Scratch

Constructing neural networks from the ground up with detailed code walkthroughs, starting with perceptrons and progressing to multi-layer networks that can recognize handwritten digits.

## Introduction

This chapter covers neural networks: building artificial brains from scratch. Content will be added here.


:::{note}
This is an important note for readers.
:::


## Code Example

```python
# Example code for Neural Networks: Building Artificial Brains from Scratch
print("Hello from Chapter 5!")
```


## Mathematical Concepts

Here's an example equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi x} d\xi
$$

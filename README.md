# Introduction to Machine Learning

A 2000 level college textbook about Machine Learning.  Should be very practical, should start with an introduction that's almost a TED talk that explains the concept intuitively, in the style of, let's say, Arvin Ash.

Then it should move on to a step-by-step with code, and the code very well explained to reinforce.

And, lastly, should have a really solid ending. That's the style that I want.

Also, I want to make sure that their exercises and the exercises should be guided code exercises, and then I want there to also be problems where you just give them the problem without the guides, and they have to solve the entire thing. Make it about eight chapters.
